Introduction:
-------------
    What is DKP?
    ------------
    DKP, short for Dragon Kill Points, is a concept originally created by Thott of Afterlife.
    These points are awarded to each guild member as they attend a guild raid. The current DKP
    of each member reflects his or her priority for loot. When a member 'wins' an item, they
    lose a DKP amount that reflects the value of that item.

    DKP allows for an unbiased comparison between guild members when decisions about loot are to
    be made based on attendance and recent items that have been awarded.

    What is EQdkp?
    --------------
    EQdkp is an OpenSource DKP system created out of necessity.  Many guilds wanted to use the
    point system but didn't have the means or time or will to create their own set of scripts
    for managing it. The main focus of EQdkp is to make loot distribution as easy as possible for
    guild leaders while still allowing it to be easy to maintain.

    EQdkp was originally created with the notion that one closed-source installation of it would
    support many guilds' point systems.  It was later changed to an OpenSource orientation so
    that it would much more customizable for each guild.

Contact:
--------
    Bug reports and feature requests should be directed to the SourceForge tracker:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/eqdkp/

    Installation issues, general discussion - just about anything that's not a bug
    report or feature request can be directed to the forums:
    http://forums.eqdkp.com/

    If you're using EQdkp, we'd love to hear from you.  If you have a moment, post your site in
    the 'Examples' forum.

Donations:
----------

    If you and your guild use and enjoy EQdkp and want to see it continue to be developed, donating
    whatever money you can is a good way to show your appreciation for all of the work that's gone into the
    development and maintenance of the EQdkp project.

    Why do you need donations?
    --------------------------
    A lot of time went into creating EQdkp, and still goes into maintaining it by fixing bugs and adding requested
    features - in general, making it better.

    In addition to that, hosting fees for EQdkp.com need to be paid on a monthly basis, and donations would help greatly
    with that.

    If half of the guilds currently using EQdkp had around half of its members donate 50 cents one time, 
    that would probably cover the cost of the EQdkp.com server for one year. Additional money would go 
    to the developers of EQdkp for donating their time.
