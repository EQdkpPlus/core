[*] #679701
[+] parse_log now displays how many log lines were parsed and how many members were found.

[ ] Checkbox generation for permissions on Configuration and Manage Users is now dynamic to allow easier integration for plugins.

[ ] Settings menus are now array-driven.
[+] Implemented a new, entirely object-oriented plugin system.  Draelon did a ton of work on this, so many thanks to him for contributing to making this work.  Aside from being very easy to utilize in plugins, it also vastly improved the efficiency of EQdkp's plugin foundation.
