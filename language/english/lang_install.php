		<h3>Articlesystem</h3>
		<p>Instead of news and infopages, we introduced a complete new article system. Each news and page is now an article. You can group your articles using article-categories. Moreover, you can realise for example blogs for your guild and users.</p>
		<p>You can divide a single article using the Readmore- and Pagebreak-Methods. Also, you can insert Image-Galeries, Items or Raidloot using the appropriate Editor-Buttons.</p>
		<h3>Media-Management</h3> <p>Using the new Media-Management in ACP or Editor, you can now easily insert Media into your articles. For example, files can be uploaded using Drag&Drop. Also, you can even edit images in the Filebrowser.</p>
		<h3>Calendar</h3><p>Planing raids was never been easier by using Drag&Drop. Also, public and private events can be created, people can be invited and tell you if they participate or not.</p>
		<h3>Menu-Management</h3> <p>We have removed all menus except one. And the last one could be totally configured. You can position the entries using Drag&Drop in 3 levels, so it\'s possible to create submenus. You can still create links to external pages, but also add direct links to articles or articlecategories.</p>
		<h3>Portal-Management</h3> <p>In former times, there was only one portallayout, you had on every page the same portal modules. That\'s why we implemented the portallayouts. Now you can assign a portallayout to each articlecategory.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, you can create own portal blocks that you can embedd in your template, for example for editing links in your footer.</p>',
